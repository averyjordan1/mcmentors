Initially it will feature an overview of the program, a list of the mentors who are participating in MCM, and a form to request access to the mentorship network. Over time, it will also be updated to include general resources for applying to out of state schools.  e resource section aims to be a  ltered set of the resources available on the web, primarily those that were useful to mentors when they applied to schools. College con dential provides a well established alternative to these re- sources, but, as anyone who has used college con dential is aware, college con den- tial certainly has biases and sometimes irrational advice.</p>
